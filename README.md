## 🧠 Memory System

MindShell includes a session-scoped memory store. You can save values by name and reuse them in subsequent commands.

```
You: remember 100 as limit
AI: Stored 100 as 'limit'

You: use limit
AI: limit = 100
```

If a command expects a number but none is provided, it automatically falls back to the last stored value under the key `"last"`.

---

## 🔍 Smart Suggestions

If you mistype a command, MindShell uses **Levenshtein distance** to find the closest match and suggest a correction:

```
You: fibonaci 5
AI: 🤔 Did you mean: 'fibonacci'?
```

## 🏗️ Project Structure

```
MindShellCLI.java          ← CLI version (all-in-one file)
MindShellSwing.java        ← GUI version (all-in-one file)
```

All supporting logic (Fibonacci, Prime, Calculator, etc.) is implemented as inner/companion classes within each file for easy portability.
